# This repository serves as a platform for sharing my work as a Web Development Intern during the Virtual Internship Program at Oasis Infobytes, taking place in July 2023. I am grateful to the Oasis Infobytes team for providing me with this opportunity to enhance my skills and contribute to exciting projects IDE:- VS Code Technologies:- HTML, CSS & JavaScript

`` Task 1- Calculator ``: It takes a little skill to create a calculator with basic mathematical functionalities using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Calculators require an interactive interface to perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. It will need a display screen to display the user’s input and give the results. The grid system in CSS is for the alignments of buttons on the calculator. The additional tools you need to build a fully functional calculator include eventListeners, if-else statements, operators, loops, and so on.

``Task 2:- Tribute Page``: With a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, we can easily create a page for someone you admire. Write about what you adore in the person, add images, give an appealing layout, use paragraphs appropriately. We can also play around with different font styles and background colors.

``Task 3:A Basic To Do WebApp``: A basic to-do app that enables a user to add daily tasks. The to-do web app must allow users to add new items to a list, and items added to a list is to be visible. Also, a user can mark a task “complete” upon its successful completion and user can edit & delete their tasks.
